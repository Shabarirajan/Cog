* **_Ask any professional gamer what is the most important aspect of improving as a player, and 9/10 times they will tell you that it’s all about the mindset.How you approach a game is wildly important when it comes to how much you improve,or even if you improve. So today, we will try to point you on the right path with methods and mindsets to improve yourselfin VALORANT._**

* **_I’m a passionate for self-improvement, whether it’s with my graphic designing, my aim, or any new hobby I pick up, I always try to inform myself, and find ways to improve efficiency. One of the first things I picked up on this path to building up my skills is how the mental aspect of improving at a certain skill is just as important as working on the mechanical aspects of it. For a game like VALORANT, the mentality you have when going into a competitive match or a deathmatch is going to greatly change what you take out of the experience. With the change of attitude or change of thoughts while playing, you can go from actively getting worse, to making leaps in your game. All of it comes through learning how to replace your bad habits with good ones, being critical of yourself, and the thoughts you should be thinking when watching others or yourself._**

* **_Determining what it means to have a good mentality is not an easy question to answer, mostly due to the fact that a good mentality is made up of several factors that all need to be worked on separately, that all mesh together to create an environment for yourself that fosters personal growth and mechanical improvement._**

> <b><span style="color: orange ; font-size: 15.rem;">**🕹️The parts that I personally consider the main factors that make up a mentality are:**</span></b>


* *_Motivation_*
* *Confidence*
* *Habit building*
* *Self-criticism (the right amount)*
* *Ego*

* **_This may seem obvious, but if you do not want to improve at something, you won’t. But sometimes even when you want it, motivation can be hard to find. When it comes to improving at a skill, like VALORANT for example, sometimes you will feel like you are not improving or getting worse and will think about giving up. Feeling unmotivated at times is completely normal and usually happens for several reasons. Let’s talk about those reasons and then suggest methods to motivate yourself._**

* **_Valorant servers have faced some issues recently. Players have encountered the “game disconnection issues” while playing a match and as a result, they received AFK penalties._**

* **_Another major concern that needs to be addressed. Riot has previously taken some strict steps to resolve this issue in-game. However, they are still receiving a lot of complaints from the players. On the flipside, the developers need more improved features to tackle this problem._**

* **_Map has been a common problem ever since Valorant's release. While playing back-to-back games, players are queued on the same map simultaneously. Sometimes, it is very frustrating for a player to compete on the same map multiple times._**

* **_In Patch 4.04, developers have made some key changes to gameplay mechanics. According to some players, Valorant has become more of an FPS game after the update._**
**This is the start of VALORANT Episode 4 Act II, the one focused on cleaning house. It starts with the promised Yoru overhaul, a reshaping of the Controller role, and a renovation to Icebox (don’t skip that Ascent update though).
The pure changes are listed below, but we have two special dev articles lined up that will dive deeper behind the changes and goals for the Controller Agent and Icebox updates**

* **The developers have mentioned rank system issues in their earlier updates as well. The rank rating system, hidden MMR and other details are still doubtful to many users.**
**Sometimes players feel that they are not rewarded enough as per their involvement in the game. Many professional players such as Hunter "SicK" Mims, Spencer "Hiko" Martin and more have explained why the rank system needs to be improved.**
**However, Riot is still trying to figure out a full-proof system while players are expecting the developers to find a solution in the next few updates.**
